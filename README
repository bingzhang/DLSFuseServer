It is the high performance Metadata information transferring& retrieval system.
Or it is the high performance RPC messaging system.

I use alot asynchronization techniques to build up it.

Already have all those components designed and implemented:

1) the high performance in-memory concurrent cache.
2) muti-threads asynchronization system.
3) adaptive prefetching mechanism in WAN metadata transferring.
4) support multiple TCP streams and pipelining on Ftp protocol family like ftp, gridftp, gsiftp.
5) passive persistent streams management, including TCP streams failure recovery.
6) support ftp protocol metadata transferring on both control&data channel.
